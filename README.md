## 🏗️ System Architecture  
The chatbot follows a modular architecture:  

1. **User Input Layer** – Text/voice query from the user.  
2. **Watson Assistant** – Intent recognition, entity extraction, and dialogue management.  
3. **AI Logic Layer** – Custom logic for responses and contextual learning.  
4. **Response Layer** – Returns meaningful, context-aware responses.
